sudo apt install plocate

locate build_info.json


STEP BY STEP:

1. bash file that runes which command and finds path to discord
2. ask user to enter the updated version from discord
3. nodejs file that inputs and changes the json file with sudo and saves it automatically


LET USERS KNOW TO ADD CHOWN AND CHMOD TO FILE with current users to allow it to write with the current user and not the sudo

sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/discord/resources/build_info.json
sudo chown $(whoami) /usr/share/discord/resources/build_info.json
